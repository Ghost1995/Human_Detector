\subsection*{Overview}

Human detection is an old and important problem in the field of object detection.\+Current technologies easily detect static obstacles. But, detecting dynamic obstacles has always been tough.\+In dynamic obstacles, human obstacles are the most important as any collision might lead to injury or loss of life which is highly undesirable for any product. This has generated a need for an accurate detector for making the algorithms more robust and efficient.

To this extent we propose an algorithm that can detect humans in frame by making rectangular bounding boxes around individual humans. The center position of the rectangle will be used as the pixel location in that frame. The pixel coordinates can then be used with a robots intrinsic and extrinsic transformations (not considered in this project) to track the human with respect to the robot world frame. We would be using Histogram of Oriented Gradient (H\+OG) as the feature extractor. Support Vector Machine (S\+VM) will be used as a classifier which will be using the extracted H\+OG features as a classifying factor. The data set used for training images will be from Caltech \href{http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/CaltechPedestrians/}{\tt Pedestrian Dataset} or the \href{http://pascal.inrialpes.fr/data/human/}{\tt I\+N\+R\+IA Person Dataset}

\#\# Standard install via command-\/line 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 git clone https://github.com/anirudhtopiwala/Human\_Detector.git
2 cd <path to repository>
3 mkdir build
4 cd build
5 cmake ..
6 make
7 Run tests: ./test/cpp-test
8 Run program: ./app/detect
\end{DoxyCode}


\#\# Building for code coverage 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 sudo apt-get install lcov
2 cmake -D COVERAGE=ON -D CMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Debug ../
3 make
4 make code\_coverage
\end{DoxyCode}
 This generates a index.\+html page in the build/coverage sub-\/directory that can be viewed locally in a web browser.
